# How to contribute

We are looking for help identifying typos and broken links, as well as suggestions on how to improve the curriculum. If you'd like to contribute, please read the guidelines below. 

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to reactiveops/apprentice-learning-plan](https://github.com/reactiveops/apprentice-learning-plan/pulls) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request, we'll review it, and merge it if it's ready to go, or ask for changes. 

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
