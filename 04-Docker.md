# Part IV: Docker

## Objectives: 
By the end of this module, the SRE will: 
- Describe the directives from a sample dockerfile 
- Explain layers and the docker cache 
- Start a docker container that runs ubuntu linux 
- Describe the following container concepts:
  - base image
  - single pid
  - command vs entrypoint
  - logs
  - volumes
  - layers and ordering
  - caching
  - build
  - push

## Deliverables 
1. Complete the project described below. Answer the questions, then schedule a time to meet with your mentor and discuss the what you've built.  

### Docker 
  - Install docker
  - `docker login` to reactiveops quay and dockerhub
    - https://hub.docker.com/u/reactiveops/dashboard/
    - https://quay.io/organization/reactiveops
  - create new Dockerfile from `ubuntu:16.04`
  - run  `apt-get update` and `apt-get upgrade` `--yes` on separate lines in the Dockerfile
  - Build the docker file.  
    - `docker build -t intro_to_docker .`
    - How many steps were there?
      
  - Build again
    - Why doesnâ€™t it take as long?
      - The ubuntu image is already downloaded and can be referred to by its id (5e8b97a2a082)
      - Docker cache!
        - `---> Using cache`
        -  `---> 1dcd45e300d7`
      - Every layer checks the Docker cache
        - The docker cache are images that exist on the disk 
  - Use `docker history <image>` to see each step and its layer id
    - Count the number of lines by using `|` `wc -l` 
    - `docker history d57d088b85d1 | wc -l` 
    - 9 lines! 
  - replace the two lines with `apt-get update && apt-get upgrade` `--yes` and build again
    - How many steps were there? 
    - What is `&&`? 
    - Use `wc -l` here
    - Why were there fewer steps? 
- Start a docker container that runs ubuntu linux 
  - `docker run -it <image_id> bash` 
  
1.  Using the `ADD` and `RUN` directives, add one of the scripts from before to the image and build the image. 
    - Does the first step get run again or is cache used?
      
2. Move the `ADD` directive so it is above the `RUN` directive and build the image
    - Is cached used this time? 
    - Why not?
3. Use the `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` directives in turn the Dockerfile to make the script run by default
4. Rewrite the Dockerfile using `ADD`  and `CMD` to add the script and run the command.  

- Create a container using your latest image
`docker run -it <image_id> bash`
  - How is this different than `docker run -it <image> bash`?
  - Run the docker image as a daemon with `sleep 3600` as the main process
  `docker run -d <image_id> sleep 3600`
  - `exec` into the running container and run `ps -ef` to view the running processes
  - `docker exec -it <container_id> bash` 
    - What is the `pid` of the `sleep` process? 
    - What happens if you `kill` that pid
