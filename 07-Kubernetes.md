# Part VII: Kubernetes

## Objectives:
By the end of this module, the DevOps Engineer will:
1. Create a K8s cluster with AWS EKS
1. Deploy a prebuilt app to a cluster
1. Expose the app to the internet
1. Add a Horizontal Pod AutoScaler
1. Load test the app with Apache Bench
1. Delete your hpa, service, deployment and cluster


## Deliverables
Watch this [EKS Workshop](https://www.eksworkshop.com/beginner/) video and follow along by deploying this application: https://github.com/FairwindsOps/k8s-workshop/tree/master/complete/.

The workshop is long, and if it is your first time deploying an app to Kubernetes it will take a while. Schedule regular times to checkin with your mentor before, during and after this module.
