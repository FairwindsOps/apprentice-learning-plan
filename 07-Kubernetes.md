# Part VII: Kubernetes 

## Objectives: 
By the end of this module, the SRE will: 
1. Create a K8s cluster with Google Kubernetes Engine
1. Deploy a prebuilt app to a cluster
1. Expose the app to the internet
1. Add a Horizontal Pod AutoScaler
1. Load test the app with Apache Bench
1. Delete your hpa, service, deployment and cluster


## Deliverables 
Watch this [Kubernetes 101 Workshop](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC6M23w-Wn5mA_bomV6YVB5elNw7IsHt5) video and follow along by deploying this application: https://github.com/FairwindsOps/k8s-workshop/tree/master/complete/. 

The video is long, and if it is your first time deploying an app to Kubernetes it will take a while. Schedule regular times to checkin with your mentor before, during and after this module.
