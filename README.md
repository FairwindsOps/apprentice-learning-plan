# ReactiveOps Apprentice Learning Plan 

This is an example learning plan for new Site Reliability Engineers. 

## Prerequisites
This plan assumes that the new SRE can do the following: 
* Navigate the command line with `cd` 
* Create, list and destroy directories and files with `mkdir`, `touch`, `ls`, and `rm` 
* Build a 'hello world' web application in a language of their choice. 

If you're new to the command line, please spend some time on the first two levels of the [Command Line Module on ShortCutFoo](https://www.shortcutfoo.com/app/dojos/command-line).

If you're new to building web applications, find and work through a 'hello world' tutorial in Python, Ruby, Go, JavaScript, or another language that interests you. 


## For Mentors: 
* Create a new copy of repo and update as needed based on the skillset of your incoming-SRE.

## For Apprentice-Level SREs 
* Fork and clone this repo, and start working through the plan starting with `01-Git`. Note the deliverables, and work with your mentor to setup times to meet and review your work.
