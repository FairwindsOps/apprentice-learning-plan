# Fairwinds Apprentice Learning Plan

This is an example learning plan for new Site Reliability Engineers.

## Prerequisites
This plan assumes that the new DevOps Engineer has used their terminal and can do the following:
* Fork and clone a remote repository
* Navigate the command line with `cd`
* Create, list and destroy directories and files with `mkdir`, `touch`, `ls`, and `rm`
* Build a 'hello world' web application in a language of their choice.

If you're still learning these skills, check out these resources:
* Github Guide: [How to Clone a Repo](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)
* The first two levels of the [Command Line Module on ShortCutFoo](https://www.shortcutfoo.com/app/dojos/command-line)
* If you're new to building web applications, find and work through a 'hello world' tutorial in Python, Ruby, Go, JavaScript, or another language that interests you.


## For Mentors:
* Create a new copy of repo and update as needed based on the skillset of your incoming-SRE.

## For Apprentice-Level SREs
* Fork and clone this repo, and start working through the plan starting with `01-Git`. Note the deliverables, and work with your mentor to setup times to meet and review your work.
