# ReactiveOps Apprentice Learning Plan 

This is an example learning plan for new Site Reliability Engineers. 

## For Mentors: 
* Create a new copy of repo and update as needed based on the skillset of your incoming-SRE.

## For Apprentice SREs 
* Fork and clone this repo, and start working through the plan starting with `01-Git`. Note the deliverables, and work with your mentor to setup times to meet and review your work.
