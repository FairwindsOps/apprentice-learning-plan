# Part I: Git
 
## Objectives
By the end of the module, the SRE will create, configure and make changes to a repo using the following commands: 

  - `init` 
  - `config` 
  - `clone`
  - `commit`
  - `branch`
  - `checkout`
  - `merge`
  - `rebase`
  - `rebase` `-i`

## Deliverables: 

1. Video record yourself creating a new directory, initializing a git repository and creating a simple file with text. Then, create a new branch, add to the file, go back to the master branch and merge the files. Hint: make sure you add and commit your changes on each branch! 
2. Video record yourself cloning a repo. Create a new branch, then go back to the master branch and make changes to a file. Checkout to your new branch and make more changes to the same file. Return to the master branch and combine the files using `rebase`. Hint: Make all these changes locally and don’t push them up to github. 
3. Do the same thing as #2, but use `rebase -i` 
4. Describe a scenario when you would you merge vs. rebase. Describe a scenario when you would you rebase vs. merge.

Send your deliverables to the person helping you with your learning plan.
